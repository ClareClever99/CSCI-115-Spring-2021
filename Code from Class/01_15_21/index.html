    <h3>Thank God it's Friday</h3>
    <p>I'm so glad that the weekend is here. It's our first long weekend of the semester, with <b>Martin Luther day</b> coming.</p>
    <p>It will be a long time before our next break because there is no real <b>Spring Break</b> this semster.</p>

<blockquote>We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive.
     He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the
      power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and
       some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we
        are less prone to hate our enemies.
        <br>
        <i> ~ Martin Luther King, Jr.</i>
