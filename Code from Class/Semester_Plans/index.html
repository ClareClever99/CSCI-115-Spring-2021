        <h1>Spring Semester Plans</h1>
        <p>
            I am looking forward to this semester being easier to anticipate than the Fall semester. 
            With the newness of our situations last semester, people mostly didn't know what to expect.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is time to work hard and get down to business to make this an excellent semester. 
            Spring is my best time of year anyway. So here's hoping for the best.
