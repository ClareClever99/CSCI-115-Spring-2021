	To set background ROYGBIV rainbow. Of course, we would not harm a real webpage like this. Maybe apply to a smaller element that needs dressing up. (eg. background to png img).

	Furthermore, I would use a monochrome-like color scheme to keep it from being outlandish.( eg. navy blue and black)

	The loud and garrulous colors here are to make the example noticable.
