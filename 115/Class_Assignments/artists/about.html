              <h2>Early years</h2>
              <p>
                Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in
                Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North
                Brabant in the Netherlands.

                  <img
                    style="float: left"
                    class="aboutIMG"

                  />
                </a>
                He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh
                (1822–1885), a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his
                wife Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the
                name of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a
                year before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh
                family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a
                degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, had six
                sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have
                been named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).

              <h2>Etten, Drenthe and The Hague</h2>
              <p>
                Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay
                with his parents. He continued to draw, often using his
                neighbours as subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed
                cousin, Cornelia "Kee" Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's
                older sister Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a
                visit.
                <a href="./images/Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_016.jpg">
                  <img
                    style="float: right"
                    class="aboutIMG"
                    src="./images/Thumb/Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_016Thumb.jpg"

                  />
                </a>
                He was thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven
                years older than he was and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh
                surprised everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing
                marriage. She refused with the words "No, nay, never" ("nooit,
                neen, nimmer"). After Kee returned to Amsterdam, Van Gogh went
                to The Hague to try to sell paintings and to meet with his
                second cousin, Anton Mauve. Mauve was the successful artist Van
                Gogh longed to be. Mauve invited him to return in a few months
                and suggested he spend the intervening time working in charcoal
                and pastels; Van Gogh went back to Etten and followed this
                advice.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h2>Emerging artist</h2>
              <p>
                In Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working
                outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of
                weavers and their cottages. Van Gogh also completed The
                Parsonage Garden at Nuenen, which was stolen from the Singer
                Laren in March 2020.

                  />
                </a>
                From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten
                years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love and
                he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to
                marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot
                was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived
                after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March
                1885, his father died of a heart attack.

              <h2>Artistic breakthrough</h2>
              <p>
                Ill from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February
                1888 Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He seems to have moved
                with thoughts of founding an art colony.

                The Danish artist Christian Mourier-Petersen became his
                companion for two months, and, at first, Arles appeared exotic.
                In a letter, he described it as a foreign country: "The Zouaves,
                the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First
                Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a
                dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to
                me creatures from another world."
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h2>Death</h2>
              <p>
                On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest
                with a 7mm Lefaucheux à broche revolver. There were no witnesses
                and he died 30 hours after the incident. The shooting may have
                taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or
                a local barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed
                through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal
                organs – probably stopped by his spine.

                    class="aboutIMG"

                  />
                </a>
                He was able to walk back to the Auberge Ravoux, where he was
                attended to by two doctors, but without a surgeon present the
                bullet could not be removed. The doctors tended to him as best
                they could, then left him alone in his room, smoking his pipe.
                The following morning, Theo rushed to his brother's side,
                finding him in good spirits. But within hours Vincent began to
                fail, suffering from an untreated infection resulting from the
                wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July. According to Theo,
                Vincent's last words were: "The sadness will last forever".

              <h2>Artistic development</h2>
              <p>
                Van Gogh drew, and painted with watercolours while at school,
                but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has
                been challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an
                elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus,
                owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam,
                asked for drawings of The Hague.
                <a href="./images/1280px-Van_Gogh_The_Olive_Trees..jpg">
                  <img
                    style="float: right"
                    class="aboutIMG"
                    src="./images/Thumb/1280px-Van_Gogh_The_Olive_TreesThumb.jpg"

                  />
                </a>
                Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered
                a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail,
                but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered;
                he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable
                shutters and different drawing materials. For more than a year
                he worked on single figures – highly elaborate studies in black
                and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later,
                they were recognised as early masterpieces.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h2>Major series</h2>
              <p>
                Van Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the
                periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He
                was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting
                conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual
                outlook throughout.
                <a href="./images/800px-Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_059.jpg">
                  <img
                    style="float: left"
                    class="aboutIMG"
                    src="./images/Thumb/800px-Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_059Thumb.jpg"
                    alt="Books"
                  />
                </a>
                His evolution as an artist was slow, and he was aware of his
                painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose
                himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his
                technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the
                moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh
                used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for
                when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his
                then current situation.

              <hr />
              <h2>Portraits</h2>
              <p>
                The portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn.
                <a
                  href="./images/800px-Van_Gogh_-_Bildnis_der_Mutter_des_Künstlers.jpeg"
                >
                  <img
                    style="float: right"
                    class="aboutIMG"
                    src="./images/Thumb/800px-Van_Gogh_-_Bildnis_der_Mutter_des_KünstlersThumb.jpeg"
                    alt="Mother"
                  />
                </a>
                He believed they were "the only thing in painting that moves me
                deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite." He wrote to
                his sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure,
                and that he would use colour to capture their emotions and
                character rather than aiming for photographic realism. Those
                closest to Van Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he
                rarely painted Theo, Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of
                his mother were from photographs.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h2>Self-portraits</h2>
              <p>
                Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and
                1889.
                <a
                  href="./images/800px-Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project_(454045).jpg"
                >
                  <img
                    style="float: left"

                  />
                </a>
                They were usually completed in series, such as those painted in
                Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his death.
                Generally the portraits were studies, created during
                introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others,
                or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h2>Flowers</h2>
              <p>
                Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including
                roses, lilacs, irises, and sunflowers. Some reflect his
                interests in the language of colour, and also in Japanese
                ukiyo-e. There are two series of dying sunflowers. The first was
                painted in Paris in 1887 and shows flowers lying on the ground.
                The second set was completed a year later in Arles and is of
                bouquets in a vase positioned in early morning light. Both are
                built from thickly layered paintwork, which, according to the
                London National Gallery, evoke the "texture of the seed-heads".
              </p>
              <hr />
              <h2>Cypresses and olives</h2>
              <p>
                Fifteen canvases depict cypresses, a tree he became fascinated
                with in Arles. He brought life to the trees, which were
                traditionally seen as emblematic of death. The series of
                cypresses he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance,
                as windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought
                them to the foreground. Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889:
                "Cypresses still preoccupy me, I should like to do something
                with them like my canvases of sunflowers"; he went on to say,
                "They are beautiful in line and proportion like an Egyptian
                obelisk."

              <h2>Reputation and legacy</h2>
              <p>
                After Van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his
                reputation grew steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and
                collectors.

                In 1887, André Antoine hung Van Gogh's alongside works of
                Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, at the Théâtre Libre in Paris;
                some were acquired by Julien Tanguy.[281] In 1889, his work was
                described in the journal Le Moderniste Illustré by Albert Aurier
                as characterised by "fire, intensity, sunshine". Ten paintings
                were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels
                in January 1890. French president Marie François Sadi Carnot was
                said to have been impressed by Van Gogh's work.

                After Van Gogh's death, memorial exhibitions were held in
                Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in
                several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at Les XX;
                in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels. In
                1892, Octave Mirbeau wrote that Van Gogh's suicide was an
                "infinitely sadder loss for art ... even though the populace has
                not crowded to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh,
                whose demise means the extinction of a beautiful flame of
                genius, has gone to his death as obscure and neglected as he
                lived."

                Theo died in January 1891, removing Vincent's most vocal and
                well-connected champion.

                Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was a Dutchwoman in her
                twenties who had not known either her husband or her
                brother-in-law very long and who suddenly had to take care of
                several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as
                her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Gauguin was not
                inclined to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation,
                and Johanna's brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about
                his work. Aurier, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters among
                the critics, died of typhoid fever in 1892 at the age of
                twenty-seven.

                In 1892, Émile Bernard organised a small solo show of Van Gogh's
                paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh
                paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger.
                In April 1894, the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris agreed to take
                10 paintings on consignment from Van Gogh's estate. In 1896, the
                Fauvist painter Henri Matisse, then an unknown art student,
                visited John Russell on Belle Île off Brittany. Russell had been
                a close friend of Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the
                Dutchman's work, and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Influenced by
                Van Gogh, Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for
                bright colours.

                Van Gogh's nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh
                (1890–1978), inherited the estate after his mother's death in
                1925.

                During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a
                complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and
                several languages. He then began negotiations with the Dutch
                government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the
                entire collection. Theo's son participated in planning the
                project in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the
                best possible conditions. The project began in 1963; architect
                Gerrit Rietveld was commissioned to design it, and after his
                death in 1964 Kisho Kurokawa took charge. Work progressed
                throughout the 1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand
                opening.

                The Van Gogh Museum opened in the Museumplein in Amsterdam in
                1973.

                It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands,
                after the Rijksmuseum, regularly receiving more than 1.5 million
                visitors a year. In 2015 it had a record 1.9 million.
                Eighty-five percent of the visitors come from other countries.
