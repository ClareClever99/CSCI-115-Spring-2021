            <h2>Early years</h2>
            <p>
              Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in
              Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province of North
              Brabant in the Netherlands.

              </a>
              He was the oldest surviving child of Theodorus van Gogh
              (1822–1885), a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church, and his wife
              Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819–1907). Van Gogh was given the name
              of his grandfather and of a brother stillborn exactly a year
              before his birth. Vincent was a common name in the Van Gogh
              family: his grandfather, Vincent (1789–1874), who received a
              degree in theology at the University of Leiden in 1811, had six
              sons, three of whom became art dealers. This Vincent may have been
              named after his own great-uncle, a sculptor (1729–1802).

            <h2>Etten, Drenthe and The Hague</h2>
            <p>
              Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with
              his parents. He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as
              subjects. In August 1881, his recently widowed cousin, Cornelia
              "Kee" Vos-Stricker, daughter of his mother's older sister
              Willemina and Johannes Stricker, arrived for a visit. He was
              thrilled and took long walks with her. Kee was seven years older
              than he was and had an eight-year-old son. Van Gogh surprised
              everyone by declaring his love to her and proposing marriage. She
              refused with the words "No, nay, never" ("nooit, neen, nimmer").
              After Kee returned to Amsterdam, Van Gogh went to The Hague to try
              to sell paintings and to meet with his second cousin, Anton Mauve.
              Mauve was the successful artist Van Gogh longed to be. Mauve
              invited him to return in a few months and suggested he spend the
              intervening time working in charcoal and pastels; Van Gogh went
              back to Etten and followed this advice.

            <h2>Emerging artist</h2>
            <p>
              In Nuenen, Van Gogh focused on painting and drawing. Working
              outside and very quickly, he completed sketches and paintings of
              weavers and their cottages. Van Gogh also completed The Parsonage
              Garden at Nuenen, which was stolen from the Singer Laren in March
              2020. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter
              ten years his senior, joined him on his forays; she fell in love
              and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to
              marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot
              was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived
              after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885,
              his father died of a heart attack.

            <hr />
            <h2>Artistic breakthrough</h2>
            <p>
              Ill from drink and suffering from smoker's cough, in February 1888
              Van Gogh sought refuge in Arles. He seems to have moved with
              thoughts of founding an art colony. The Danish artist Christian
              Mourier-Petersen became his companion for two months, and, at
              first, Arles appeared exotic. In a letter, he described it as a
              foreign country: "The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little
              Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his
              surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people
              drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world."
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Death</h2>
            <p>
              On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with
              a 7mm Lefaucheux à broche revolver. There were no witnesses and he
              died 30 hours after the incident. The shooting may have taken
              place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local
              barn. The bullet was deflected by a rib and passed through his
              chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs – probably
              stopped by his spine. He was able to walk back to the Auberge
              Ravoux, where he was attended to by two doctors, but without a
              surgeon present the bullet could not be removed. The doctors
              tended to him as best they could, then left him alone in his room,
              smoking his pipe. The following morning, Theo rushed to his
              brother's side, finding him in good spirits. But within hours
              Vincent began to fail, suffering from an untreated infection
              resulting from the wound. He died in the early hours of 29 July.
              According to Theo, Vincent's last words were: "The sadness will
              last forever".

            <h2>Artistic development</h2>
            <p>
              Van Gogh drew, and painted with watercolours while at school, but
              only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been
              challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an
              elementary level. In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus,
              owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam,
              asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up
              to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying
              the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the
              result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his
              studio using variable shutters and different drawing materials.
              For more than a year he worked on single figures – highly
              elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him
              only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Major series</h2>
            <p>
              Van Gogh's stylistic developments are usually linked to the
              periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was
              inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting
              conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual
              outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and he
              was aware of his painterly limitations. He moved home often,
              perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through
              exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa
              McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes,
              and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a
              coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the
              realities of his then current situation.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Portraits</h2>
            <p>
              The portraits gave Van Gogh his best opportunity to earn. He
              believed they were "the only thing in painting that moves me
              deeply and that gives me a sense of the infinite." He wrote to his
              sister that he wished to paint portraits that would endure, and
              that he would use colour to capture their emotions and character
              rather than aiming for photographic realism. Those closest to Van
              Gogh are mostly absent from his portraits; he rarely painted Theo,
              Van Rappard or Bernard. The portraits of his mother were from
              photographs.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Self-portraits</h2>
            <p>
              Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and
              1889. They were usually completed in series, such as those painted
              in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly before his
              death. Generally the portraits were studies, created during
              introspective periods when he was reluctant to mix with others, or
              when he lacked models, and so painted himself.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Flowers</h2>
            <p>
              Van Gogh painted several landscapes with flowers, including roses,
              lilacs, irises, and sunflowers. Some reflect his interests in the
              language of colour, and also in Japanese ukiyo-e. There are two
              series of dying sunflowers. The first was painted in Paris in 1887
              and shows flowers lying on the ground. The second set was
              completed a year later in Arles and is of bouquets in a vase
              positioned in early morning light. Both are built from thickly
              layered paintwork, which, according to the London National
              Gallery, evoke the "texture of the seed-heads".
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Cypresses and olives</h2>
            <p>
              Fifteen canvases depict cypresses, a tree he became fascinated
              with in Arles. He brought life to the trees, which were
              traditionally seen as emblematic of death. The series of cypresses
              he began in Arles featured the trees in the distance, as
              windbreaks in fields; when he was at Saint-Rémy he brought them to
              the foreground. Vincent wrote to Theo in May 1889: "Cypresses
              still preoccupy me, I should like to do something with them like
              my canvases of sunflowers"; he went on to say, "They are beautiful
              in line and proportion like an Egyptian obelisk."

            <h2>Reputation and legacy</h2>
            <p>
              After Van Gogh's first exhibitions in the late 1880s, his
              reputation grew steadily among artists, art critics, dealers and
              collectors. In 1887, André Antoine hung Van Gogh's alongside works
              of Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, at the Théâtre Libre in Paris;
              some were acquired by Julien Tanguy.[281] In 1889, his work was
              described in the journal Le Moderniste Illustré by Albert Aurier
              as characterised by "fire, intensity, sunshine". Ten paintings
              were shown at the Société des Artistes Indépendants, in Brussels
              in January 1890. French president Marie François Sadi Carnot was
              said to have been impressed by Van Gogh's work.
            </p>
            <p>
              After Van Gogh's death, memorial exhibitions were held in
              Brussels, Paris, The Hague and Antwerp. His work was shown in
              several high-profile exhibitions, including six works at Les XX;
              in 1891 there was a retrospective exhibition in Brussels. In 1892,
              Octave Mirbeau wrote that Van Gogh's suicide was an "infinitely
              sadder loss for art ... even though the populace has not crowded
              to a magnificent funeral, and poor Vincent van Gogh, whose demise
              means the extinction of a beautiful flame of genius, has gone to
              his death as obscure and neglected as he lived."
            </p>
            <p>
              Theo died in January 1891, removing Vincent's most vocal and
              well-connected champion. Theo's widow Johanna van Gogh-Bonger was
              a Dutchwoman in her twenties who had not known either her husband
              or her brother-in-law very long and who suddenly had to take care
              of several hundreds of paintings, letters and drawings, as well as
              her infant son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. Gauguin was not inclined
              to offer assistance in promoting Van Gogh's reputation, and
              Johanna's brother Andries Bonger also seemed lukewarm about his
              work. Aurier, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters among the
              critics, died of typhoid fever in 1892 at the age of twenty-seven.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1892, Émile Bernard organised a small solo show of Van Gogh's
              paintings in Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh
              paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In
              April 1894, the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris agreed to take 10
              paintings on consignment from Van Gogh's estate. In 1896, the
              Fauvist painter Henri Matisse, then an unknown art student,
              visited John Russell on Belle Île off Brittany. Russell had been a
              close friend of Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman's
              work, and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Influenced by Van Gogh,
              Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright colours.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h2>Van Gogh Museum</h2>
            <p>
              Van Gogh's nephew and namesake, Vincent Willem van Gogh
              (1890–1978), inherited the estate after his mother's death in
              1925. During the early 1950s he arranged for the publication of a
              complete edition of the letters presented in four volumes and
              several languages. He then began negotiations with the Dutch
              government to subsidise a foundation to purchase and house the
              entire collection. Theo's son participated in planning the project
              in the hope that the works would be exhibited under the best
              possible conditions. The project began in 1963; architect Gerrit
              Rietveld was commissioned to design it, and after his death in
              1964 Kisho Kurokawa took charge. Work progressed throughout the
              1960s, with 1972 as the target for its grand opening.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Van Gogh Museum opened in the Museumplein in Amsterdam in
              1973. It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands,
              after the Rijksmuseum, regularly receiving more than 1.5 million
              visitors a year. In 2015 it had a record 1.9 million. Eighty-five
              percent of the visitors come from other countries.
