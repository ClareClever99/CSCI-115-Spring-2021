          <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
          <dd>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
            Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be
            opened, and a private deck.

          <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
          <dd>
            Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down
            quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave,
            and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink
            with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
            located in the lodge.

          <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
          <dd>
            Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
            changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
            bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
