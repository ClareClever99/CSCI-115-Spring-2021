        <h2>Life on Earth</h2>
        <p>
          Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that
          have biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining
          processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have
          ceased (they have died), or because they never had such functions and
          are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as
          plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. Biology is
          the science concerned with the study of life.

        <h2>Being Environmentally Friendly</h2>

          <li style="list-style-type: none"><p>Enjoy Life</p></li>
          <li style="list-style-type: none"><p>Stress Relief</p></li>
          <li style="list-style-type: none"><p>Improve Awareness</p></li>

        </ul>
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
          The future is the time after the present. Its arrival is considered
          inevitable due to the existence of time and the laws of physics. Due
          to the apparent nature of reality and the unavoidability of the
          future, everything that currently exists and will exist can be
          categorized as either permanent, meaning that it will exist forever,
          or temporary, meaning that it will end. In the Occidental view, which
          uses a linear conception of time, the future is the portion of the
          projected timeline that is anticipated to occur. In special
          relativity, the future is considered absolute future, or the future
          light cone.
