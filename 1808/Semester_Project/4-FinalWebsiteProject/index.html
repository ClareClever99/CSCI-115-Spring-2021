              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                Artificial intelligence, also known as <i>AI</i>, is an area of
                study in the field of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">
                  computer science
                </a>
                . AI is concerned with the development of computers able to
                engage in <u>human-like thought processes</u> such as learning,
                reasoning, and self-correlation.

                AI has been used in several different lines of work ranging from
                a hospital room to the battlefield.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artificial intelligence is <i>changing the world</i>. It is used
                almost everywhere and has <b>limitless possibilities</b>. AI was
                developed to simplify the mundane tasks that humans perform.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI has come a long way since it began to become mainstream in
                the 1950s. From the very beginning, AI’s goal was to be
                <i>useful</i>
                to humans.
              </p>

                </p>
              </figure>
              <p>
                However, numerous <b>questions</b> regarding the usefulness of
                AI still exist… Has AI gone too far? Has it reached the point of
                no return? It is all too hard to tell.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this ever-emerging technical world,
                <u>AI has become a necessary tool</u> used by many
                <a href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/">Fortune 500</a>
                companies. Those who do not use artificial intelligence will be
                left behind.
              </p>
              <p>
                The good thing is that AI is an umbrella term for many different
                forms of algorithms used to make computers act
                <b>intelligently</b>.
              </p>

                All companies could benefit from AI. Determining how AI will be
                used and maintained will lead to a better understanding of the
                <i>future</i> and its ethical landscape.

                Recreating the <i>complex</i> thought processes of humans seems
                like an insurmountable feat. However, AI does just that.
                Artificial intelligence is a form of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">
                  machine learning
                </a>
                that tries to <u>recreate</u> human intelligence. It is
                typically told to perform tasks that would otherwise require
                human interaction. AI is <b>always learning</b> and will
                constantly evolve at the tasks it performs.

                Artificial intelligence works in very <i>mysterious</i> ways. AI
                operates on <b>large amounts of data</b>. It uses fast iterative
                processing and intelligent
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">
                  algorithms
                </a>
                to automatically learn patterns and features in a dataset. AI
                has <u>5 basic phases</u>: gathering input, processing input,
                analyzing output, finalizing assessments, and adjusting. The
                adjustment phase allows AI to constantly learn and improve.

                The field of AI has been around for a long time.
                <u>Early philosophers</u> questioned how human thinking could be
                <i>artificially mechanized</i>. In 1950,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">
                  Alan Turing
                </a>
                proposed a test that measured a machine’s ability to replicate
                human actions to a degree that was indistinguishable from human
                behavior. As a result, AI started to become <b>mainstream</b>.
                AI has come a long way since its mid-century rise.
