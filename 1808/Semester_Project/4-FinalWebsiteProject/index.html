              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, is an area of study
                in the field of computer science. AI is concerned with the
                development of computers able to engage in human-like thought
                processes such as learning, reasoning, and self-correlation.

              <p>
                AI has been used in several different lines of work ranging from
                a hospital room to the battlefield.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artificial intelligence is changing the world. It is used almost
                everywhere and has limitless possibilities. AI was developed to
                simplify the mundane tasks that humans perform.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI has come a long way since it began to become mainstream in
                the 1950s. From the very beginning, AI’s goal was to be useful
                to humans.

                </a>
              </figure>
              <p>
                However, numerous questions regarding the usefulness of AI still
                exist… Has AI gone too far? Has it reached the point of no
                return? It is all too hard to tell.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this ever-emerging technical world, AI has become a necessary
                tool used by many Fortune 500 companies. Those who do not use
                artificial intelligence will be left behind.
              </p>
              <p>
                The good thing is that AI is an umbrella term for many different
                forms of algorithms used to make computers act intelligently.
              </p>

              </figure>
              <p>
                All companies could benefit from AI. Determining how AI will be
                used and maintained will lead to a better understanding of the
                future and its ethical landscape.
