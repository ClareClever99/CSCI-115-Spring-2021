                learning to do its assigned task. Most supervised machine
                learning models perform better with low bias, as these

                This is effectively another way to say artificial intelligence.
                It’s used by marketing teams at some companies to avoid the
                science fiction aura that sometimes surrounds AI.

                This subset of AI is particularly focused on developing
                algorithms that will help machines to learn and change in
                response to new data, without the help of a human.

              <td>
                A loosely-defined term referring to the product of AI training,
                created by running a machine learning algorithm on training
                data.

              <td>
                Also called a neural net, this is a computer system designed to
                function like the human brain. Although researchers are still
                working on creating a machine model of the human brain, existing
                neural networks can perform many tasks involving speech, vision
                and board game strategy.

                The umbrella term for any machine’s ability to perform
                conversational tasks, such as recognizing what is said to it,
                understanding the intended meaning and responding intelligibly.

              <td>
                An important AI term, overfitting is a symptom of machine
                learning training in which an algorithm is only able to work on
                or identify specific examples present in the training data. A
                working model should be able to use the general trends behind
                the data to work on new examples.

              <td>
                A variable inside the model that helps it to make predictions.
                Their value can be estimated using data and they are usually not
                set by the person running the model.

                The distinction between this and machine learning is often
                blurry, but this field is basically concerned with finding
                trends and patterns in data.

            <tr>
              <td class="expression">Predictive Analytics</td>
              <td>
                By combining data mining and machine learning, this type of
                analytics is built to forecast what will happen within a given
                timeframe based on historical data and trends.

            <tr>
              <td class="expression">Reinforcement Learning</td>
              <td>
                This is a method of teaching AI which sets a goal that doesn’t
                have specific metrics, encouraging the model to test different
                scenarios rather than find a single answer. Based on human
                feedback, the model can then manipulate the next scenario to get
                better results.

            <tr>
              <td class="expression">Supervised Learning</td>
              <td>
                This is a type of machine learning where structured datasets,
                with inputs and labels, are used to train and develop an
                algorithm.

                The unlabeled data used to check that a machine learning model
                is able to perform its assigned task.

            <tr>
              <td class="expression">Training Data</td>
              <td>
                This refers to all the data used during the process of training
                a machine learning algorithm, as well as the specific dataset
                used for training rather than testing.

            <tr>
              <td class="expression">Turing Test</td>
              <td>
                Named after Alan Turing, this tests a machine’s ability to pass
                for a human, particularly in the fields of language and
                behavior. After being graded by a human, the machine passes if
                its output is indistinguishable from that of human participants
                in the test.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="expression">Unsupervised Learning</td>
              <td>
                This is a form of training where the algorithm is asked to make
                inferences from datasets that don’t contain labels. These
                inferences are what help it to learn.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="expression">Variance</td>
              <td>
                The amount that the intended function of a machine learning
                model changes while it’s being trained. Despite being flexible,
                models with high variance are prone to overfitting and low
                predictive accuracy, since they are reliant on their training
                data.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="expression">Variation</td>
              <td>
                Also called queries or utterances, these work in tandem with
                intents for Natural Language Processing. The variation is what a
                person might say to achieve a certain purpose or goal. For
                example, if the intent is “pay by credit card”, the variation
                might be “I’d like to pay by card, please.”
