              <h3>Ethical AI</h3>
              <p>
                Countless tools and technologies have been used to aid humans
                throughout history. Artificial intelligence is one of these
                tools. AI has numerous applications in the real world. It is
                used for good when it is supplementing human knowledge, not
                replacing it.
              </p>
              <p>
                AI can be used to enhance the intelligence of humans. It was
                created as a tool to help humans. Its implementation will
                ultimately determine its characteristics.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the most common forms of ethical AI include suicide
                prevention chatbots, human resource management, intelligent
                cybersecurity, and search recommendations. These forms of AI
                show that ethical AI exists. However, all AI is not ethical.
              </p>

              <h3>Unethical AI</h3>
              <p>
                Like coding in general, AI operates on a set of hardcoded
                instructions. It can easily be told to operate in inhumane ways.
                Artificial intelligence, unlike other forms of human aid, can
                operate without human intervention.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, unethical AI can solve a beneficial problem, but traverse
                a destructive route getting there. AI will initially do what it
                is told. However, once it figures out what to do, it will break
                from human reliance and learn on its own moving forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                Feeding machines biased data will teach them to learn our
                biases, leading to further discrimination. AI learns the lessons
                we teach it and can also learn the things we did not intend to
                teach it. Algorithmic bias can cause AI to act in unethical ways
                as well.

          <h3>Areas of Failure</h3>
          <p>
            AI has lots of positives and will benefit many people. However, it
            also has lots of negatives. Privacy and security are often not at
            the center of AI. As AI evolves, its ability to use personal
            information in ways that can intrude on privacy interests increases
            almost exponentially. Artificial Intelligence also has numerous
            security vulnerabilities. Several legal issues surround AI too. The
            question of governance concerns many people. How will the law
            respond to the emergence of AI? The legality of AI is not the only
            thing that is holding it back. Its continued use as a form of data
            mining is often seen as unethical. Its last negative is its
            association with social issues. AI often runs into the problem of
            having to choose what is best for itself as opposed to what is best
            for others. Forcing a computer to make life-or-death decisions is
            tragic and should be avoided at all costs.
