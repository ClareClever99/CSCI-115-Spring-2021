                <b>Vincent van Gogh</b>, in full <b>Vincent Willem van Gogh</b>,
                (born March 30, 1853, Zundert, Netherlands—died July 29, 1890,
                Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, France), Dutch painter, generally
                considered the greatest after
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt"
                  >Rembrandt van Rijn</a
                >, and one of the greatest of the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Impressionism"
                  >Post-Impressionists</a
                >. The striking colour, emphatic brushwork, and contoured forms
                of his work powerfully influenced the current of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism"
                  >Expressionism</a
                >
                in modern art. Van Gogh’s art became astoundingly popular after
                his death, especially in the late 20th century, when his work
                sold for record-breaking sums at auctions around the world and
                was featured in blockbuster touring exhibitions. In part because
                of his extensive published letters, van Gogh has also been
                mythologized in the popular imagination as the quintessential
                tortured artist.

                  >Van Gogh is now one of the most well-known post-Impressionist
                  painters, although he was not widely appreciated in his
                  lifetime.</i

              <p>
                Vincent Van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Zundert in the
                southern Netherlands, the son of a pastor. In 1869, he took his
                first job, working in the Hague branch of an international art
                dealing firm. He began to write to his younger brother Theo, a
                correspondence which continued for the rest of Van Gogh's life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Van Gogh's job took him to London and Paris, but he was not
                interested in the work and was dismissed in 1876. He briefly
                became a teacher in England, and then, deeply interested in
                Christianity, a preacher in a mining community in southern
                Belgium.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1880, at the age of 27, he decided to become an artist. He
                moved around, teaching himself to draw and paint and receiving
                financial support from Theo. In 1886, Van Gogh joined Theo in
                Paris, and met many artists including Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec,
                Pissarro and Gauguin, with whom he became friends. His style
                changed significantly under the influence of Impressionism,
                becoming lighter and brighter. He painted a large number of
                self-portraits in this period.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1888, Van Gogh moved to Provence in southern France, where he
                painted his famous series 'Sunflowers'. He invited Gauguin to
                join him but they soon began to quarrel and one night, Van Gogh
                threatened Gauguin with a razor. Deeply remorseful he then cut
                off part of his own ear.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was the first serious sign of the mental health problems
                that were to afflict Van Gogh for the rest of his life. He spent
                time in psychiatric hospitals and swung between periods of
                inertia, depression and incredibly concentrated artistic
                activity, his work reflecting the intense colours and strong
                light of the countryside around him.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 27 July 1890, again suffering from depression, Van Gogh shot
                himself. He died two days later.
