        I am tired! Yes, you heard me right. I'm tired. But once you read this
        article, you'll understand why. For several years, I've been blaming it
        on middle age, iron poor blood, lack of vitamins, air pollution, water
        retention, saccharin,over-eating, dieting, big feet, yellow wax build-up
        and a dozen or so other maladies that make you wonder if life is really
        worth living.

      <p>
        But now I find out that those things are not the cause of my being
        tired! I'm tired simply because I am overworked!
      </p>
      <p>
        I have just figured out the breakdown of the currently employed people
        in this country and it has left me exhausted. It took quite a bit of
        studying and calculating on my part, but I think I have it all figured
        out! I know where every single American is:
      </p>

      <h2>Statistics Tell the Story</h2>
      <p>
        You see, the population of this country is right around 200 million
        people. 84 million are retired. That leaves 116 million people to do the
        work. Of that 116 million, 75 million are in school. Naturally, they can
        not be counted on to work full-time. We are now down to 41 million
        people to do all of the work. Of this total, 22 million are employed by
        the federal government. That leaves us with 19 million left to do all of
        the work in the private sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Four million are in the Armed Forces, which leave just 15 million to do
        all of the work. Take from that number a total of 14,800,000 people who
        work for state and local government and that leaves us with only 200,000
        people to do all of the work.
      </p>

      <h2>Recommendation for Action</h2>
      <p>
        Now there are 199,998 people in prisons. That leaves just two people to
        do all of the work: you and me! And you're just sitting here reading
        this stupid webpage! No Wonder I'm so tired! Get to work!!
