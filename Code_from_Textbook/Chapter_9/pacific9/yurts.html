            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p>
              Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
              ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome
              that can be opened, and a private deck.
            </p>

            <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
            <p>
              Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with
              down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge,
              microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience
              includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
              restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>
              Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
              changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful
              to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
